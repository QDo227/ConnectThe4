The objective of this program is to create a 2 players connection game in which the players 
choose a position on the board and take turns dropping a colored "discs" down at the bottom of
that position. The player that able to form a connected horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line 
first will win the game.To implement this game, the program first have to create a 6x7 game's 
board using a 2d array with a dimension exactly similar to that of the physical board in which 
the index of the array will act as the coordinates of the game's board. The program will update 
the index of 2d array everytime the player chooses a coordinate that corresponds to the index
to drop the "disc" on. The program also add an extra feature to the game to make it more interesting. 
This feature allows the player to use a special "disc" that able to remove all of the "disc" on a 
specific collumn that the player choose to gain the upper hand on the game -- each players only allowed 
to use once per game.
